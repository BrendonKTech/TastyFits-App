# 🍽️ TastyFits – Restaurant Finder & Food Ordering App

This was created as a final design project for one of my classes, I attempted to replicate an example app just to get some experience and this is the result.

> ❗Note: The app was designed in Figma without variables due to using the free version.

## 🧠 Concept

Many food delivery platforms do not provide clear filters or prompts for allergies or dietary preferences. TastyFits addresses this by asking users upfront about their dietary restrictions and personalizing restaurant and meal suggestions accordingly.

### Key Features:
- 🌍 Location-based restaurant discovery  
- ✅ Dietary restriction & allergy filtering  
- 📱 Simple food ordering interface  
- 🧾 Clean and intuitive user interface  
- 👩‍🍳 Restaurant menu preview
